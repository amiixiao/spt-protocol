# Contributing to SPT Protocol

Welcome! I am **Xiao**, a mother and an amateur developer. I designed the SPT Protocol to solve the linear context collapse I faced in my daily multi-threaded life. 

I am honored that you are interested in refining this architecture. To maintain the purity of this vision, please follow these guidelines:

###  The Core Principles
Before submitting a Pull Request (PR), ensure your contribution aligns with:
1. **Context Isolation:** Does this help prevent "context bleed" between threads?
2. **Pragmatic Sovereignty:** Does it empower the user to own and audit their AI's state?
3. **Efficiency:** Does it reduce token waste through intelligent slicing?

###  How You Can Help
We are currently looking for contributors to help with:
- **Vector Drift Algorithms:** Refining the mathematical thresholds for semantic branching.
- **State Management:** Developing robust logic for multi-branch concurrency.
- **Visual Interface:** Prototyping how a "Parallel Intelligence Tree" should look to a user.

###  Submission Process
1. **Open an Issue:** Discussion first. Explain the logic behind your proposed change.
2. **Be Respectful:** We value technical honesty over complex jargon. 
3. **License:** By contributing, you agree that your work will be licensed under the MIT License of this project.

*Let's build an AI that grows like a tree, not one that dissipates like smoke.*
